# Edge-case regression guard for `Style/ColonMethodCall`.
#
# The vendor spec covers the canonical detection / autocorrect path and the
# main exclusions (camel-case constructor, Java static type, Java package
# namespace), but a number of structural quirks were uncovered during
# implementation by probing stock rubocop directly. Those quirks are pinned
# here because corpus parity is disposable (clean corpora produce few
# offenses for this cop, so a regression might not surface) and because the
# AST shape the cop relies on differs subtly between parser-gem and prism in
# a few corner cases:
#
# - **`(const nil? :Java)` vs `cbase` receiver**: stock's `java_type_node?`
#   pattern is `(send (const nil? :Java) _)`. The pattern's `nil?` matches a
#   **nil receiver on the `const` node**, NOT a `cbase` receiver. So
#   `::Java::int` (where the receiver of `int` is `(const cbase :Java)`) is
#   FLAGGED by stock — the java-type guard does not apply when `Java` is
#   resolved at the top level via `::`. In prism a top-level `::Java`
#   constant is a `ConstantPathNode` (not a `ConstantReadNode`), so the
#   wrapper's `receiver.as_constant_read_node()` gate is structurally
#   correct: only the bare `ConstantReadNode` named `Java` triggers the
#   exclusion. Vendor spec has no example for the `cbase` variant, but the
#   distinction is load-bearing (a refactor of the guard could silently
#   regress).
# - **Java package followed by user call (`Java::foo::bar`)**: the inner
#   `Java::foo` is excluded by the java-type guard, but the outer `bar`
#   (whose receiver is `Java::foo` — a `CallNode`, not a constant) is NOT
#   excluded. Stock flags only the outer `::`. Vendor spec has neither a
#   chained-java fixture nor a fixture with a non-constant receiver, so the
#   recurse-into-children behaviour and the guard's per-call scope are
#   pinned here.
# - **Non-constant receiver shapes**: vendor spec only exercises `Class`
#   (`ConstantReadNode`) and `test` (`CallNode`) as receivers. In stock the
#   only structural guards depend on the message name (camel case) and the
#   receiver shape (java type node). Other receiver shapes — instance
#   variable (`@x::y`), expression in parens (`(1+2)::to_s`), explicit
#   self (`self::y`) — must all flag. Pinned because the wrapper relies on
#   prism's `receiver().is_some()` gate which covers every receiver kind
#   indistinguishably.
# - **`csend` (safe navigation)**: `foo&.bar` uses `&.` as its operator, not
#   `::`. csend with `::` is not valid Ruby. The wrapper checks the operator
#   bytes are `::` exactly, so safe-navigation calls fall through. Pinned to
#   guard the operator-bytes check against accidental relaxation to "any
#   two-byte operator".
# - **Constant-only path (`Foo::Bar::Baz`)**: this is pure constant
#   resolution (`ConstantPathNode`), not a method call — there is no
#   `CallNode` and stock never visits it via `on_send`. Pinned because a
#   future broadening of the visitor (e.g. visiting `ConstantPathNode` to
#   share work with another cop) could accidentally synthesise offenses
#   here.
# - **Camel-case method on non-Java receiver (`Foo::Bar()` vs `Foo::baz`)**:
#   the `camel_case_method?` guard checks the method name's FIRST byte for
#   `[A-Z]`, not the receiver. Pinned because a future refactor mis-reading
#   `camel_case_method?` as "receiver is camel-case" would let a normal
#   constructor through.
# - **Visitor recursion**: vendor spec only places offending calls at the
#   top level. Pinned that the visitor recurses into method bodies, block
#   bodies, and into the *argument expressions* of an enclosing call, so a
#   future walk-pruning refactor cannot silently regress nested cases.
